Time to complete the task : 3.5 Hours

Insights:
I wanted to initially use an IRQ on DONE pin. But due to time constraints and problems faced in testing the code, I decided to use a polling approach. 
I am also not sure how to ultimately check the code as time_us function would only update with time. 
I have concentrated more on completing the code using the given datasheet/manual and less on testing the code.
